# EFI
OpenCore EFI files for my laptop, intended to be used with macOS Sonoma (should work with Sequoia however). Do not CTRL-C & CTRL+V this - it will likely not work. Uses OC version `1.0.2`.

## Specifications
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5500U (6 cores, 12 threads)
- **GPU:** iGPU, 1 GB of VRAM
- **RAM:** 1x 8 GB DDR4 running at 3200 MHz
- **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth:** Originally a Realtek RTL8822CE, replaced with an Intel AX200
- **SSD:** A `GIGABYTE GP-GSM2NE3256GNTD` NVMe that honestly sucks (40% wearout with only 19 TB written/read)

## What works
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
- Ethernet
- All USB ports
- Speakers
- Sleep
- Keyboard
- Trackpad
- iGPU

## What doesn't
- AirDrop
- HDMI audio
- Hardware DRM/VCN
- Mute LED on keyboard
- Most Continuity features (only functional ones seem to be Universal Clipboard & Handoff)

## Kexts
Below is a list of kernel extensions that are used, along with the functionality that each one serves:

For kernel extensions not included in this repository, you should get them from the official source instead.

## Known issues
- Some apps don't work properly with < 1 GB of video memory
  - **Affected versions:** macOS 10.15+
  - **Workaround:** increase to at least 1 GB using [Smokeless-UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF).
- AirportItlwm does not work
  - **Affected versions:** macOS 15+
  - **Workarounds:**
    - Use itlwm.kext with HeliPort instead.
    - If you *really* are desperate, [patch your system using OCLP](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues/1009), but note that OCLP is unsupported on hackintoshes. 
- iServices don't work when using AirportItlwm.kext
  - **Affected versions:** macOS 14+
  - **Workarounds:**
    - Use itlwm.kext with HeliPort instead.
    - If you *really* are desperate, [patch your system using OCLP](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues/1009), but note that OCLP is unsupported on hackintoshes. 
    - microsocks can also be used - see [this issue](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues/942).
- `bluetoothd` might randomly start crashing or require a full system reboot
  - **Affected versions:** exact versions unknown, confirmed to affect macOS 13.6.7+
  - **Workaround:** you can try using `sudo purge && sudo pkill -9 bluetoothd BlueTool` on a Terminal. I still do not know why this happens.
- HDMI audio, hardware encoding/decoding and hardware DRM is non-functional
  - **Affected versions:** macOS 10.15+
  - **Workaround:** N/A, see [this issue](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed/issues/225) for HDMI audio and [this one](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed/issues/28) for hardware DRM/VCN.
